-- Registers --

There will be 16 general purpose registers, each 32-bit


-- General Purpose Registers --
Function argument registers (Don't need to be preserved by callees, though
interrupts should preserve them):  r0-r3
r0 is used for return values <= 32 bits
r0:r1 is used for return values == 64 bits, with r0 as high byte and r1 as
low byte

Scratch registers (They need to be preserved by the callee):  r4-r13

Link register (call instructions save the return address here):  lr, aka
r14

Stack pointer:  sp, aka r15


-- Special Registers --
Program counter:  pc
There won't be any way to perform pc-relative loads.  Instead, there
will be variable-length instructions that permit 32-bit immediate values.
